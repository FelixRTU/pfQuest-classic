If you want to install the addon just download the zip, extract it and rename the folder to "pfQuest-classic". move it into your interface folder.

This is a work of my free time, i won't give any guarantee that everything is working perfectly or in a way where one would say it is nice code. It is more ore less an adaption to the current wow lua standards.

I think i got almost everything working how it used to be on private servers. Things like minimap nodes, waypoints with arrows, the database browser, questlog integration, chat slash commands.    

If you have a problem, feel free to write something in the Issues, make a request etc..
 
Maybe someone finds this useful and as a starting point for fore future improvements.
