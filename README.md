If you want to install the addon just download the zip, extract it and move it into your interface folder.

This is a work of my free time, i won't give any guarantee that everything is working perfectly or in a way where one would say it is nice code. It is neither a "full rewite" as Shaggy said it has to be, it is more ore less an adaption to the current lua standards.

I think i got almost everything working how it used to be on private servers. Things like minimap nodes, waypoints with arrows, the database browser, questlog integration, chat slash commands.    

If you have problems, feel free to write something in the Issues, make a request or make your own clone.
 
Maybe someone finds my work useful and as a starting point for more improvement in the future
